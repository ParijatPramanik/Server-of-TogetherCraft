</font>
<font face="Arial">
Appeal by SCP Albatross_OP to provide  players netherite ingots that they had in The Officerate of TOGETHERCRAFT.<br><ol>
<li> The server was not abandoned by our own will. We all did hard work in survival. And twice at that.</li>
<li> Only the tools to be compensated.</li></ol>
<br><i>Verdict</i><br>
Within the next 24 hours, I want with full honesty, supported by at least one member, the list of the tools you had in The Officerate. If number of netherite tools exceed 3 then those tools would not be considered for compensation. You shall be compensated as seen fit.<br><br><br></font><font face="Georgia">

Petition by SCP Albatross_OP to change the current Capital Resettlement (Construction) Project<br><ol>
<li> We did a lot of progress in tht castle and so again repeating those will be a bad idea and boring too (I know my teamamates they live anything new)
<li> Since ICSE is coming so we must build little and not that huge we can never complete it
<li> <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKZ36uW8BdjizS1OxSIvtCUeMGy_1JaGn">The above castle to be built.[click]</a></ol>

<li> However, if a better castle layout plan is proposed by 22nd of May, then the castle layout plan shall be put to vote or accepted directly. Designs(links) from other members will also be welcomed.</li>
<li> Until then, no changes in project are made.</li>
<li> We can always build the castle after ICSE. It shall be saved.</li>
